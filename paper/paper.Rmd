# Summary

{lavaanExtra} is an R package that offers an alternative and vector-based
syntax to the package {lavaan}, as well as other convenience functions such
as naming paths and defining indirect effects automatically. It also
offers convenience formatting optimized for publication and script
sharing workflows.

# Statement of need

{lavaan} [@lavaanPackage] is a very popular R package for structural
equation modeling (SEM). The package requires familiarizing oneself with a
specific syntax to define latent variables, regressions, covariances,
indirect effects, and so on, but this syntax is neither very intuitive for
beginners nor very modular for more advanced users. Furthermore, it is 
relatively difficult to extract relevant statistical outputs in the form of
tables and figures that are suitable for scientific publication.

{lavaanExtra} does mainly two things to address these issues. First, it offers 
an alternative, code-efficient modular syntax that allows automatizing certain 
steps. Second, it facilitates the analysis-to-publication workflow by providing 
publication-ready tables and figures following the style requirements of the 
American Psychological Association (APA).

## Usage

There is a single function at the center of the proposed alternative
syntax, `write_lavaan()`. The idea behind `write_lavaan()` is to define
individual components (regressions, covariances, latent variables,
etc.), provide them to the function, and have it write the `lavaan`
model, so the user does not have to worry about making typos in the
specific symbols required for each aspect of the model.

There are several benefits to this approach. Some `lavaan` models can
become very large. By defining the entire model every time, such as is
typical with {lavaan} users, not only do we break the DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself) principle, but our scripts can also become long and unwieldy.
This problem gets worse in the scenario where we want to compare several
variations of the same general model. `write_lavaan()` allows the user
to reuse code components, say, only the latent variables, for future
models.

This aspect also allows better control over the user's code. If the user
makes a mistake in one of, say, five SEM models definition, the user will
have to change it at all five places within the script. With
`write_lavaan()`, the user only needs to change it once, at the appropriate
location, and it will update future occurrences automatically since it
relies on reusable components.

The vector-based approach also allows the use of functions to define
components. For example, if all scale items are named consistently, say
`x1` to `x50`, one can use `paste0("x", 1:50)` instead of typing all the
items by hand and risk making mistakes.

Another issue with `lavaan` models is the readability of the code defining
the model. One can go to lengths to make it pretty, but not everyone
does, and many people do not use the same strategies to organize the
information of the model definition. With `write_lavaan()`, not only is the model
information standardized, but it is also neatly divided into clear and
useful categories.

Finally, for beginners, it can be difficult to remember the correct
`lavaan` symbols for each specific operation. `write_lavaan()` uses
intuitive names to convert the information to the correct symbols,
meaning the user does not have to rely on memory as much. Even for
people familiar with `lavaan` syntax, this approach can save time. The 
function also offers the possibility to define the named
paths automatically with clear and intuitive names.

I provide a simple Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) example below using
the `HolzingerSwineford1939` dataset [@holzinger1939study]. The dataset 
contains the mental ability test scores of children. In this example, we want 
to define the latent variables `visual` (visual perception ability), 
`textual` (reading and writing ability), and `speed` (processing speed ability), 
which are defined by items 1 to 9, respectively. We can then use the `cat()` 
function on the resulting object (of type character) to read it in the 
traditional way and make sure we have not made any mistake.

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
library(lavaanExtra)
library(lavaan)
library(tidySEM)
```

```{r}
library(lavaanExtra)

latent <- list(visual = paste0("x", 1:3),
               textual = paste0("x", 4:6),
               speed = paste0("x", 7:9))

model.cfa <- write_lavaan(latent = latent)
cat(model.cfa)
```

Should we want to use these latent variables in a full SEM model, we do
not need to define the latent variables again, only the new components.
In the example below, I add regressions, covariances, and indirect effects to 
the model. Two of our latent variables (`textual` and `speed`) are now 
predicted by our mediating variable, `visual`. In turn, `visual` is now 
predicted by our independent variables, `grade` (the students' grade) and 
`ageyr` (the students' age, in years).

With the `lavaanExtra` syntax, when defining our lists of components, we
can think of the `=` sign as "predicted by", a bit like `~` for
regression. There is an exception to this for the `indirect` object,
which also allows specifying our variables directly instead. When such
is the case, `write_lavaan()` will define all indirect paths
automatically.

```{r}
DV <- c("textual", "speed")
M <- "visual"
IV <- c("grade", "ageyr")

mediation <- list(speed = M, textual = M, visual = IV)
regression <- list(speed = IV, textual = IV)
covariance <- list(speed = "textual", ageyr = "grade", x4 = c("x5", "x6"))
indirect <- list(IV = IV, M = M, DV = DV)

model.sem <- write_lavaan(mediation = mediation, 
                          regression = regression, 
                          covariance = covariance, 
                          indirect = indirect, 
                          latent = latent, 
                          label = TRUE)
cat(model.sem)
```

## Tables

The `nice_fit()` function extracts only some of the most popular fit indices 
and organize them such that it is easy to compare models. There is an option to
format the table as an APA {flextable} [@flextablePackage], through the
{rempsyc} package [@rempsycPackage], using option `nice_table = TRUE`.
This `flextable` object can then be easily exported to Microsoft Word.
Below we fit our two earlier models and feed them to `nice_fit()` as a
named list:

```{r}
library(lavaan)
fit.cfa <- cfa(model.cfa, data = HolzingerSwineford1939)
fit.sem <- sem(model.sem, data = HolzingerSwineford1939)

list.mods <- list(fit.cfa = fit.cfa, fit.sem = fit.sem)
fit_table <- nice_fit(list.mods, nice_table = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=F}
fit_table
```

![](fit_table.png)

The table can then be saved to word simply using
`flextable::save_as_docx()` on the resulting `flextable` object.

```{r, eval=F}
flextable::save_as_docx(fit_table, path = "fit_table.docx")
```

It is similarly possible to prepare APA tables in Word with the
regression coefficients (`lavaan_reg()`), covariances (`lavaan_cov()`),
correlations (`lavaan_cor()`), or indirect effects (`lavaan_ind()`). For
example, for indirect effects:

```{r, include=F, eval=F}
x <- lavaan_ind(fit.sem, nice_table = TRUE)
flextable::save_as_docx(x, path = "ind_table.docx")
```

```{r, eval=F}
lavaan_ind(fit.sem, nice_table = TRUE)
```

## Figures

There are several packages designed to plot SEM models, but few that
people consider satisfying or sufficiently good for publication. There
are two packages that stand out however, {lavaanPlot}
[@lavaanPlotPackage] and {tidySEM} [@tidySEMPackage]. Yet, even for
those excellent packages, most people do not view them as
publication-ready or at least optimized in the best possible way.

This is what `nice_lavaanPlot` and `nice_tidySEM` aim to correct. Let's
compare the default `lavaanPlot()` and `nice_lavaanPlot()` outputs
side-by-side for demonstration purposes.

```{r nice_lavaanPlot}
lavaanPlot::lavaanPlot(model = fit.sem)

nice_lavaanPlot(fit.sem)
```

As these figures demonstrate, `nice_lavaanPlot()` has several elements
frequently requested by researchers (especially in psychology): (a) a
horizontal, rather than vertical, layout; (b) the coefficients appear by
default (but only significant ones); (c) significance stars; and (d) the
use of a sans serif font (as required by APA style for figures).

Even so, `nice_lavaanPlot` is not perfectly optimal for publication, for
example for the use of curved lines, which many researchers dislike.
Nonetheless, it will still yield excellent and satisfying results for a
quick and easy check.

The best option for publication then is `nice_tidySEM`. Let's first look
at the default output of the base `tidySEM::graph_sem()` for reference.

```{r graph_sem, fig.width=14, fig.height=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tidySEM::graph_sem(fit.sem)
```

The author of the {tidySEM} package notes that

> This uses a default layout, provided by the `igraph` package. However,
> the node placement is not very aesthetically pleasing. One of the
> areas where tidySEM really excels is customization. [@tidySEMWebsite]

In this sense, most of the time, both `tidySEM` and `nice_tidySEM` will
need a layout in order to yield the best result. One of the benefits of
`nice_tidySEM` is that when our model is simply made of three "levels":
independent variables, mediators, and dependent variables (e.g., for a
path analysis, or if we do not want to draw the items for a full SEM),
it is possible to automatically specify a proper layout by simply
feeding it the `indirect` object that we created earlier.

```{r nice_tidySEM, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, message=FALSE}
nice_tidySEM(fit.sem, layout = indirect)
```

For the time being, `nice_tidySEM` only supports this three-level
automatic layout, but designs with more levels are in the works. In the
meantime, when the model is more complex (or that we want to include
items), it is necessary to specify the layout manually using a matrix or
data frame, which allows fine-grained control over the generated figure.

```{r}
mylayout <- data.frame(
  IV = c("x1", "grade", "", "ageyr", ""),
  M = c("x2", "", "visual", "", ""),
  DV = c("x3", "textual", "", "speed", "x9"),
  DV.items = c(paste0("x", 4:8)))
as.matrix(mylayout)
```

```{r nice_tidySEM2, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
nice_tidySEM(fit.sem, layout = mylayout, label_location = 0.70)
```

If the figure is still not sufficiently satisfying, it is possible to
store the output as a `tidy_sem` object (by using `plot = FALSE`), which
can then be modified according to regular `tidySEM` syntax. This can be
useful to fine-tune and finalize the figure.

```{r nice_tidySEM3, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
x <- nice_tidySEM(fit.sem, layout = mylayout, label_location = 0.65, 
                  reduce_items = c(x = 0.4, y = 0.2), plot = FALSE)
from <- x$edges$from
to <- x$edges$to
x$edges[from == "grade" & to == "speed", "curvature"] <- 40
x$edges[from == "ageyr" & to == "textual", "curvature"] <- -40
plot(x)
```

The resulting figure can be saved using `ggplot2::ggsave()`
[@ggplot2Package]:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot2::ggsave("my_semPlot.pdf", width = 8, height = 6)
```

Other differences between {tidySEM} and `nice_tidySEM()` are that: (a)
the latter displays standardized coefficients by default (but
unstandardized coefficients can be specified with `est_std = FALSE`),
(b) if using standardized coefficients, the leading zero is omitted (as
preferred by many researchers); (c) does not plot the variances by default, 
(d) uses full double-headed arrows instead of dashed lines with no arrows
for covariances, (e) has further arguments for easy customization (e.g.,
`reduce_items`), and (f) allows defining an automatic layout in specific
cases (as described earlier).

Finally, the base function, `tidySEM::graph_sem()`, is difficult to
customize in depth. For the aesthetics of `nice_tidySEM()`, for example,
we need to rely instead on the {tidySEM}'s `prepare_graph()`,
`edit_graph()`, and numerous conditional formatting functions. In
contrast to `nice_tidySEM()`, these `tidySEM` functions act more like a
grammar of SEM plotting, akin to the popular grammar of graphics,
{ggplot2} [@ggplot2Package]. This provides great flexibility, but for
the occasional user, also comes with an additional burden, as users may
for example need to skim through almost 400 undocumented functions,
should they want to conditionally edit the resulting `tidy_sem` object.
